<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tyreese Naidu, I am currently studying web development and enjoy learning different codes and languages.I am currently in
  the intermediate class for the HTML Language and i am trying to show off my current learnt skills. I know i have a long way 
  before i reach my full potential but learning has never been an issue for me. There are still many codes to learn and master 
  , soon they will also be on my portfolio but for now these are my current skills.
